# TwitchFlix
---

## About
> TwitchFlix is based on a simple idea in which the user is randomly served a stream without them picking. The overall picture would be to allow the user to filter what kind of streams they may be interested in and being able to find a streamer that matches their interest that they may not have been able to find otherwise.

### Currently
> Currently the web application is a minimal product. As in, it will just randomly serve you one of the top 100 streams currently playing right now. Feel free to browse the projects tab to see what's being planned.

### Running Locally
> The project should be simple to setup and run locally. You can use yarn or npm, but it's more so setup for yarn. After downloading the source, all you need to do is run yarn install & yarn serve.
